# Progress: Day-3 / header-scroll-animation

- title: Day-3 Header Scroll Animation Implementation
- tasks:
  - Create custom hook `useScrollDirection` for scroll detection
  - Update TopBar component with conditional visibility and smooth transitions
  - Adjust Header component positioning logic for topbar hide/show
  - Add CSS transitions and transform animations with proper easing
  - Implement throttled scroll listeners for performance optimization
  - Handle edge cases (page top, rapid scrolling, mobile responsiveness)
  - Add minimum scroll threshold before triggering animations
  - Ensure RTL support and maintain auth/language switcher accessibility
  - Test scroll behavior across all pages and viewports
  - Add proper cleanup for scroll event listeners
- criteria:
  - Smooth header animations on scroll with no jank
  - Professional UX with 300-400ms transition timing
  - TopBar hides on scroll down, shows on scroll up
  - Main Header adjusts positioning accordingly
  - No performance impact with throttled scroll detection
  - Full functionality maintained in both languages
  - Mobile and desktop responsiveness verified
  - Type-check and lint compliance
  - Build succeeds
